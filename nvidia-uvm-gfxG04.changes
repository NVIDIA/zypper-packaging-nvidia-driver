- update to latest long lived branch version 346.47
   * Fixed a bug that could cause rendering corruption in GLX clients using
     PBOs and/or VBOs when using GLX indirect rendering.
   * Fixed a bug that caused Xinerama layouts which included X screens with
     'Option "UseDisplayDevice" "none"' to be represented incorrectly in
     the nvidia-settings control panel.
   * Fixed a bug that could cause glXSwapBuffer() to block for longer than
     necessary in multi-threaded GLX applications using the
     GLX_NV_delay_before_swap extension.
   * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications using the NV_path_rendering
     extension to crash after a modeswitch event.
   * Added support for the following GPUs:
     * Quadro K620M
     * Quadro K2200M
     * GeForce GTX 960
     * GeForce GTX 965M
   * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort audio to stop working after monitors
     are hotplugged.

- added missing PCI IDs (bnc#920799)        

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  2 11:14:50 UTC 2015 - sndirsch@suse.com

- update to latest long lived branch version 346.35 (G04 series)
  * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce 800A
        * GeForce 800M
  * Updated the NVIDIA X driver to reject frame packed interlaced HDMI 3D
    modes during mode validation. These modes were being validated by the
    driver, despite never having been supported.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the console from being restored after
    forcefully terminating X, on some GPUs with multiple DisplayPort
    monitors attached. This bug also subsequently prevented X from being
    started following the failed console restoration.
  * Updated the version of libvdpau shipped with the driver to 0.9.  This
    version honors the VDPAU_DRIVER_PATH environment variable and fixes a race
    condition if multiple threads call VdpDeviceCreateX11 simultaneously.  See
      http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/vdpau/2014-December/000274.html
    for more information.
    Please note that users are encouraged to use their distribution's libvdpau
    packages rather than relying on the one shipped with the NVIDIA graphics
    driver.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the ACPI hotkey mask to be set incorrectly on some
    laptops even when the EnableACPIHotkeys option is disabled.
  * Disabled the EnableACPIHotkeys option by default.  This option is now
    considered deprecated and will be removed in a future driver release.  On
    modern Linux systems, display change hotkey events are delivered to the
    desktop environment as key press events, and the desktop environment
    handles the display change by issuing requests through the X Resize and
    Rotate extension (RandR).
  * Fixed a bug that caused the screen image to be shifted when screen
    transformations (such as rotations or reflections) were enabled on a
    G-SYNC display attached to a Kepler-based GPU.
- fixed build for new conftest/*.h deps
- UVM kernel module no longer available for 32bit since 346.xx

    some AMD 8xx/9xx-series chipsets when used with some NVIDIA GPUs.
  * Fixed a regression that could cause system crashes when terminating the
    X server on systems with an NVIDIA Quadro SDI Capture card installed.
  * Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work on some GPUs while
    using a display that supports HDMI 3D.

    recognizing Base Mosaic layouts generated by the
    nvidia-settings control panel.

    screens running at depth 8 on some GPUs.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented GPUs from being correctly recognized
    in MetaMode strings when identified by UUID.
  * Implemented support for disabling indirect GLX context creation
    using the -iglx option available on X.Org server release 1.16
    and newer. Note that future X.Org server releases may make the
    -iglx option the default. To re-enable support for indirect GLX
    on such servers, use the +iglx option.
  * Added the "AllowIndirectGLXProtocol" X config option. This
    option can be used to disallow use of GLX protocol. See
    "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the README for more details.

    evaluating some expressions when compiling shaders.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause nvidia-installer to crash while attempting
    to run nvidia-xconfig on systems where that utility is missing.
